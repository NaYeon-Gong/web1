       target="_blank" title="to watch movie">Titanic</a> is a 1997 American epic romance and disaster film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron.
        Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, the film is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic,
         and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.</p>

     <p style="margin-top:20px;">Upon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success.
        Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve (1950) for the most Oscar nominations,
         and won 11, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben-Hur (1959) for the most Oscars won by a single film.
          With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark,
           and became the highest-grossing film ever at the time, until Cameron's Avatar surpassed it in 2010. </p>
